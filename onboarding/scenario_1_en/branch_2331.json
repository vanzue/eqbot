    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. Previously, when one of the team members, Alex, said, 'This is impossible! We can't get this done in time,' you responded by encouraging the team to stay focused and work together. During a team meeting, [Monica] slammed her pen on the table and added, 'Even if we try our best, there's no way we can meet this deadline.' [Bob] nodded in agreement, looking equally concerned. You responded by focusing on motivating the team by recalling past successes. Monica's frustration is still palpable, and Bob's agreement seems to add to the tension. [Monica] then leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms, 'It's not just about trying hard; we need more resources.' [Bob] muttered, 'Yeah, we're drowning here.' You focused on motivating the team by recalling past challenges. [Monica] sighed deeply and said, 'Motivation alone isn't going to get us through this. We need concrete action.' [Bob] added, 'We need a plan that actually addresses our current capacity.' You acknowledged their concerns and suggested a pragmatic approach.",
