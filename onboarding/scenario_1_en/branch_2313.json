    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. Previously, when one of the team members, Alex, said, 'This is impossible! We can't get this done in time,' you responded by encouraging the team to stay focused and work together. During a team meeting, [Monica] slammed her pen on the table and added, 'Even if we try our best, there's no way we can meet this deadline.' [Bob] nodded in agreement, looking equally concerned. You focused on motivating the team by recalling past successes. Monica's frustration was still palpable, and Bob's agreement seemed to add to the tension. You suggested asking for additional help and compiling a list of needs to present to management. [Monica] leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms, 'It's not just about trying hard; we need more resources.' [Bob] muttered, 'Yeah, we're drowning here.' After your suggestion, [Monica] looked slightly relieved but still skeptical, 'What if management says no? We've been turned down before.' [Bob] added, 'And what if they don't understand the urgency?' You responded by emphasizing the urgency to prove the need for additional resources. Monica tapped her fingers on the table impatiently and Bob shifted uncomfortably in his seat.",
