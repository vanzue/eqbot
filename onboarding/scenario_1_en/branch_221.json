    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. Previously, when one of the team members, Alex, said, 'This is impossible! We can't get this done in time,' you responded by encouraging the team to stay focused and work together. During a team meeting, [Monica] slammed her pen on the table and added, 'Even if we try our best, there's no way we can meet this deadline.' [Bob] nodded in agreement, looking equally concerned. You suggested taking a pause to rethink the approach. With the team gathered again, [Monica] leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms, and said, 'So, what’s the new grand plan?' You invited collaborative problem-solving by suggesting, 'Let's brainstorm some ideas together. We need everyone's input to come up with a viable plan.'",
