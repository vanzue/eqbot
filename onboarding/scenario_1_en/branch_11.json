    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. One of the team members, Alex, says, 'This is impossible! We can't get this done in time.' You responded by suggesting breaking the tasks into smaller parts. The team seemed somewhat relieved but still on edge. [Monica] and [Bob] exchange concerned looks. Monica then speaks up, 'Even with smaller tasks, the deadline is still too tight.' Bob, looking frustrated, adds, 'I don't think anyone here believes we can actually pull this off.' You then acknowledged the team's feelings and opened the floor for discussion. Now, Monica sighs and says, 'Even if we discuss our concerns, the time isn't going to magically expand.'",
