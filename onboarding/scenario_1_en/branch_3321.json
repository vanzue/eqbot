    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. One of the team members, Alex, says, 'This is impossible! We can't get this done in time.' You suggested taking a short break and coming back with a fresh perspective. Monica agreed, but Bob still seems skeptical. After the break, Bob says, 'Even with a break, I don't see how we're going to manage this.' Monica adds, 'Yeah, we need a better plan or more resources.' You suggested taking a step back to reassess the situation and offered to seek additional resources. Bob looks frustrated, and Monica seems a bit more hopeful. Bob then says, 'Revisiting our strategy is fine, but we still need a realistic plan to get this done.' Monica, looking thoughtful, says, 'Maybe we should also consider the skills and availability of each team member.' You then suggested focusing on what you could control and start tackling tasks one by one. Bob nods but still seems concerned. Monica, with a hint of optimism, says, 'Okay, let's start with what we can manage.' Bob, crossing his arms, mutters, 'This better work.' Monica looks at you and says, 'So, where do we start?' Bob still appears skeptical and adds, 'Are we even sure this plan will work?' You proposed a practical approach by focusing on immediate tasks and adjusting as needed.",
