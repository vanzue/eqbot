    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. One of the team members, Alex, said, 'This is impossible! We can't get this done in time.' You suggested taking a short break and coming back with a fresh perspective. [Monica] agreed, but [Bob] still seemed skeptical. After the break, [Bob] said, 'Even with a break, I don't see how we're going to manage this.' [Monica] added, 'Yeah, we need a better plan or more resources.' You acknowledged the team's concerns and suggested breaking down the tasks into smaller pieces and assigning them based on everyone's strengths. Now, [Monica] is looking over the task breakdown, and [Bob] is still frowning. You encouraged the team to stay focused and take a step-by-step approach. [Monica] seems a bit more optimistic, but [Bob] is still doubtful.",
