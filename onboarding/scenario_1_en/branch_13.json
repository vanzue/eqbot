    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. One of the team members, Alex, says, 'This is impossible! We can't get this done in time.' You responded by suggesting breaking the tasks into smaller parts. The team seemed somewhat relieved but still on edge. Monica and Bob exchange concerned looks. Monica then speaks up, 'Even with smaller tasks, the deadline is still too tight.' Bob, looking frustrated, adds, 'I don't think anyone here believes we can actually pull this off.' You responded by asking if anyone has a better idea or a more efficient way to get this done, otherwise, to get back to work. The team resumes work, but the tension is palpable. Monica sighs loudly and says, 'I really don't see how we can manage this.'",
