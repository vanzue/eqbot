    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. Previously, when one of the team members, Alex, said, 'This is impossible! We can't get this done in time,' you responded by encouraging the team to stay focused and work together. Now, during a team meeting, [Monica] slams her pen on the table and adds, 'Even if we try our best, there's no way we can meet this deadline.' [Bob] nods in agreement, looking equally concerned. You acknowledged Monica's feelings and suggested a pragmatic approach to prioritize work. The tension is still high. [Bob] then leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms, and said, 'Prioritizing won't change the fact that we’re understaffed and overworked. What’s the point?' You recognized Bob's concerns and suggested a practical approach to manage the workload. Despite the suggestions, the atmosphere is still tense.",
