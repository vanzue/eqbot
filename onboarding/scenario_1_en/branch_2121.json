    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. Previously, when one of the team members, Alex, said, 'This is impossible! We can't get this done in time,' you responded by encouraging the team to stay focused and work together. During a team meeting, [Monica] slammed her pen on the table and added, 'Even if we try our best, there's no way we can meet this deadline.' [Bob] nodded in agreement, looking equally concerned. You acknowledged Monica's feelings and suggested a pragmatic approach to prioritize work. The tension remained high. [Bob] then leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms, and said, 'Prioritizing won't change the fact that we’re understaffed and overworked. What’s the point?' You recognized Bob's concerns and suggested a practical approach to manage the workload. Despite the suggestions, the atmosphere was still tense. [Monica] looked at you intently, clearly still unconvinced, and said, 'Even delegating tasks won't change the fact that we simply don’t have enough time. What do you suggest we do next?' You proposed brainstorming to find possible shortcuts or efficiencies. Now, [Bob] sighs heavily and says, 'Even if we find a few shortcuts, it feels like we’re just putting a band-aid on a bigger problem.'",
