    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. One of the team members, Alex, says, 'This is impossible! We can't get this done in time.' You suggested taking a short break and coming back with a fresh perspective. [Monica] agreed, but [Bob] still seems skeptical. After the break, [Bob] says, 'Even with a break, I don't see how we're going to manage this.' You encouraged the team to stay focused and work together, showing good self-regulation and motivational skills. [Monica] adds, 'Yeah, we need a better plan or more resources.' Now, [Bob] crosses his arms and says, 'I'm still not convinced this will work. Maybe we need to rethink everything.' You suggested taking a step back and considering requesting additional resources. [Monica] looks worried and says, 'I think we need more direction. What if we can't pull this off?' [Bob], still skeptical, grumbles, 'I hope you're not just buying us time.' [Monica] nods in agreement, her worry evident. You suggested reassessing the strategy and reallocating resources. [Monica] appears slightly reassured, but [Bob] remains doubtful, raising an eyebrow.",
