    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. One of the team members, Alex, says, 'This is impossible! We can't get this done in time.' You responded by suggesting breaking the tasks into smaller parts. The team seemed somewhat relieved but still on edge. Monica and Bob exchanged concerned looks. Monica then spoke up, 'Even with smaller tasks, the deadline is still too tight.' Bob, looking frustrated, added, 'I don't think anyone here believes we can actually pull this off.' You responded by asking if anyone has a better idea or a more efficient way to get this done, otherwise, to get back to work. The team resumed work, but the tension was palpable. Monica sighed loudly and said, 'I really don't see how we can manage this.' You noticed Bob shaking his head and muttering, 'This is just setting us up for failure.' You encouraged the team to push through despite the pressure. Monica then said, 'I guess we’ll have to try our best, but I’m still worried about the quality of our work under such pressure.' Bob followed with, 'Rushing this might lead to mistakes we can't afford.' You acknowledged Monica's concerns and suggested setting up regular check-ins to monitor progress. [Monica] nodded but looked unsure, 'I'm just worried that even with check-ins, we might miss something important.' [Bob], rubbing his temple, added, 'And what if we miss a major deadline because we're too focused on details?'",
