    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. Previously, when one of the team members, Alex, said, 'This is impossible! We can't get this done in time,' you responded by encouraging the team to stay focused and work together. During a team meeting, [Monica] slammed her pen on the table and added, 'Even if we try our best, there's no way we can meet this deadline.' [Bob] nodded in agreement, looking equally concerned. You then acknowledged their frustration but emphasized the importance of focusing on what can be controlled. When Monica leaned forward exasperated, and Bob echoed the need for more time, you suggested that the team might need to work longer hours or weekends. Now, [Monica] throws up her hands in frustration, '[Monica] says, 'I don't know if I can handle working weekends on top of everything else.' [Bob] looks visibly tired and adds, 'We need a break, not more work.'",
