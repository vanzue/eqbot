    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety.\nEarlier, you acknowledged Lisa's feelings and suggested breaking down the tasks to manage them better. You also emphasized the importance of the project and asked for a team effort. Now, in the office, [Monica] and [Bob] are discussing with you. Bob looks particularly stressed and says, 'I don't see how we can get this done in time without working around the clock.' Monica chimes in, 'Yeah, and it's not fair to expect us to pull all-nighters.' After hearing your previous response, Bob says: 'I understand it's important, but this workload is really unreasonable. I don't think we can handle it without burning out.' Monica, visibly frustrated, adds, 'We need to come up with a realistic plan that doesn't exhaust us.'",
