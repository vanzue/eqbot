The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety.\nEarlier, you acknowledged Bob and Monica's frustration and suggested talking to upper management about adjusting the deadline or getting more hands on deck. Now, in the office, [Monica] and [Bob] continue to discuss the assignment with you. Bob, looking slightly relieved but still concerned, says, 'Even if we get more help, I'm not sure it's going to be enough to meet this deadline.' Monica nods, 'I agree, and I'm worried about the quality of our work suffering.'",
