    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. One of your team members, Lisa, says: 'I don't think we can meet this deadline. It's just too much work in too little time.' You responded: 'Lisa, I know it's challenging, but we can do it if we support each other and stay focused.' Now, [Monica] and [Bob] are also expressing their concerns. [Monica] looks worried and says, 'I'm afraid we're setting ourselves up for failure.' [Bob] frowns and adds, 'I agree with Monica. This is unrealistic.' You acknowledged their concerns and suggested focusing on the most critical tasks first. [Monica] sighs deeply and says, 'Even if we focus on critical tasks, this is still overwhelming.' [Bob], crossing his arms, adds, 'Yeah, we need a more practical approach.' You suggested brainstorming some immediate solutions together. [Monica] looks at you with a hint of hope, 'Okay, but where do we start?' [Bob] raises an eyebrow and mutters, 'This better be good.' You suggested thinking outside the box and finding innovative solutions to streamline the workflow. Now, [Monica] and [Bob] are waiting for your next steps. [Monica] looks at you and says, 'Innovative solutions sound great, but what if we don't have the resources?' [Bob] chimes in, 'Yeah, we might need more than just ideas.'",
