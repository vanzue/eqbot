    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety.\nEarlier, you acknowledged Lisa's feelings and suggested breaking down the tasks to manage them better. Now, in the office, [Monica] and [Bob] are discussing the assignment with you. Bob looks particularly stressed and says, 'I don't see how we can get this done in time without working around the clock.' Monica chimes in, 'Yeah, and it's not fair to expect us to pull all-nighters.' You acknowledged their concerns and suggested bringing in temporary help if needed. Despite the suggestion, Monica still seems uneasy and says, 'Even with extra help, I'm not sure we can avoid burnout.' Bob adds, 'And what if the temporary help isn't up to speed? We could end up doing more work.' You emphasized the importance of a positive attitude and asked for their best effort.\nNow, Monica rolls her eyes and says, 'I just hope this doesn't turn into another one of those impossible missions.' Bob nods in agreement, looking more frustrated.\nYou acknowledged the frustration and emphasized the need to stay focused. Monica sighs, and Bob shakes his head, both looking skeptical.",
