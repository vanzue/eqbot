    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. One of your team members, Lisa, says: 'I don't think we can meet this deadline. It's just too much work in too little time.' You responded: 'Lisa, I know it's challenging, but we can do it if we support each other and stay focused.' Now, [Monica] and [Bob] are also expressing their concerns. [Monica] looks worried and says, 'I'm afraid we're setting ourselves up for failure.' [Bob] frowns and adds, 'I agree with Monica. This is unrealistic.' You acknowledged their concerns and suggested focusing on the most critical tasks first. [Monica] sighs deeply and says, 'Even if we focus on critical tasks, this is still overwhelming.' [Bob], crossing his arms, adds, 'Yeah, we need a more practical approach.' You reassured them by suggesting breaking down the tasks further to make them less daunting. [Monica] and [Bob] are still visibly stressed, and [Monica] says, 'Breaking it down is a start, but I'm not sure if it's enough.' [Bob] nods and adds, 'We need a better plan or more help.' You encouraged the team to reflect and reassess.",
