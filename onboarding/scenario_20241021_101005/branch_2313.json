    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. One of your team members, Lisa, says: 'I don't think we can meet this deadline. It's just too much work in too little time.' You responded: 'Lisa, I know it's challenging, but we can do it if we support each other and stay focused.' Now, [Monica] and [Bob] are also expressing their concerns. [Monica] looks worried and says, 'I'm afraid we're setting ourselves up for failure.' [Bob] frowns and adds, 'I agree with Monica. This is unrealistic.' You responded: 'It's a tight deadline, no doubt. But if we don't try, we'll never know what we're capable of.' [Monica] sighs deeply, and [Bob] continues to frown, crossing his arms. You acknowledged your teamâ€™s concerns and suggested reassessing priorities, saying: 'I hear your concerns. Let's take a step back and reassess our priorities.' [Monica] still looks unconvinced and [Bob] shakes his head. You suggested considering asking for an extension, saying: 'I understand. Maybe we should consider asking for an extension if it's too overwhelming.' However, the team still seems unsure.",
