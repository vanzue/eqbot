    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. One of your team members, Lisa, said: 'I don't think we can meet this deadline. It's just too much work in too little time.' You responded: 'Lisa, I know it's challenging, but we can do it if we support each other and stay focused.' Now, Monica and Bob are also expressing their concerns. Monica looks worried and says, 'I'm afraid we're setting ourselves up for failure.' Bob frowns and adds, 'I agree with Monica. This is unrealistic.' You responded: 'I hear your concerns. Let's take a step back and reassess our priorities.' The team gathers around the table looking expectant and a bit skeptical. Monica crosses her arms, and Bob leans back in his chair, both waiting for your next move. You said: 'I know it's a lot, but if we stay focused and put in the effort, we can get it done. Let's take it one step at a time.'",
