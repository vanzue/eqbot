    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety.\nEarlier, you acknowledged Lisa's feelings and suggested breaking down the tasks to manage them better. Now, in the office, [Monica] and [Bob] are discussing the assignment with you. Bob looks particularly stressed and says, 'I don't see how we can get this done in time without working around the clock.' Monica chimes in, 'Yeah, and it's not fair to expect us to pull all-nighters.' You responded that complaining wouldn't help and that the focus should be on solving the problems. Now, Monica, with a frown, says, 'I just feel like we're not being heard. This workload is unrealistic.' Bob nods in agreement. Monica adds, 'It's demotivating to see our concerns brushed aside.'",
