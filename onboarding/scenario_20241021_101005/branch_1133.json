    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. Earlier, you acknowledged Lisa's feelings and suggested breaking down the tasks to manage them better. Now, in the office, [Monica] and [Bob] are discussing the assignment with you. Bob looks particularly stressed and says, 'I don't see how we can get this done in time without working around the clock.' Monica chimes in, 'Yeah, and it's not fair to expect us to pull all-nighters.' You acknowledged their concerns and suggested focusing on solutions rather than problems. Despite this, Monica and Bob still seem uneasy. Bob adds, 'It feels like we're just being told to suck it up and deal with it.' Monica nods in agreement and says, 'Yeah, it's easy to say 'focus on solutions,' but we're the ones burning out here.' You responded by suggesting focusing on what can be controlled and pushing through. Bob, visibly frustrated, replies, 'So, we're back to square one. Just deal with it and hope for the best?'",
