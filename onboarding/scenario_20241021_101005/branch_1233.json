    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety.\nEarlier, you acknowledged Lisa's feelings and suggested breaking down the tasks to manage them better. You also emphasized the importance of the project and asked for a team effort. Bob, after hearing your previous response, said the workload was unreasonable and he didn't think it could be handled without burning out. You responded by focusing on the need for solutions instead of dwelling on the negatives. Monica then expressed frustration about the last-minute crunches and lack of recognition, to which you replied that complaining wouldn't help. Now, in the office, [Monica] and [Bob] continue the conversation with you. Bob looks particularly irritated and says, 'Well, it feels like every time we pull this off, it's just setting us up for another impossible task.' Monica nods in agreement.",
