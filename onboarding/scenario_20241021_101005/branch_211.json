    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. One of your team members, Lisa, said: 'I don't think we can meet this deadline. It's just too much work in too little time.' You responded: 'Lisa, I know it's challenging, but we can do it if we support each other and stay focused.' Monica and Bob also expressed their concerns. Monica looked worried and said, 'I'm afraid we're setting ourselves up for failure.' Bob frowned and added, 'I agree with Monica. This is unrealistic.' You then responded: 'I hear your concerns. Let's take a step back and reassess our priorities.' The team gathered around the table looking expectant and a bit skeptical. Monica crossed her arms, and Bob leaned back in his chair, both waiting for your next move. You further proposed: 'Let's start by listing out all the tasks and see if we can delegate some of them or cut out any unnecessary steps.' Now, Monica furrows her brow and remarks, 'Even with delegation, it seems like weâ€™re biting off more than we can chew.' Bob nods, adding, 'This still feels like an impossible feat.'",
