    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety.\nEarlier, you acknowledged Lisa's feelings and suggested breaking down the tasks to manage them better. You also emphasized the importance of the project and asked for a team effort. Bob, after hearing your previous response, said the workload was unreasonable and he didn't think it could be handled without burning out. You responded by focusing on the need for solutions instead of dwelling on the negatives. Now, in the office, [Monica] and [Bob] continue the conversation with you. Monica looks frustrated and says, 'Honestly, I'm not sure why we always end up in these last-minute crunches. It's exhausting.' Bob nods in agreement.",
