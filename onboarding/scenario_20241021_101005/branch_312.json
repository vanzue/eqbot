    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. One of your team members, Lisa, says: 'I don't think we can meet this deadline. It's just too much work in too little time.' You responded by acknowledging the difficulty and suggesting to prioritize tasks and see if additional resources are needed. As the team begins to break down the tasks, [Monica] seems hesitant and [Bob] looks frustrated. You advised the team to stay focused on what they can control. [Monica] and [Bob] still seemed uneasy. You suggested reassessing priorities and postponing less urgent tasks. [Monica] and [Bob] are still uneasy, but they nod in agreement. However, the tension remains.",
