    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. One of your team members, Lisa, says: 'I don't think we can meet this deadline. It's just too much work in too little time.' You responded: 'Lisa, I know it's challenging, but we can do it if we support each other and stay focused.' Now, [Monica] and [Bob] are also expressing their concerns. [Monica] looks worried and says, 'I'm afraid we're setting ourselves up for failure.' [Bob] frowns and adds, 'I agree with Monica. This is unrealistic.' You responded: 'I understand it's tough, but maybe we can find a way to make it work if we focus on the most critical tasks first.' [Monica] crosses her arms and [Bob] runs a hand through his hair, both looking tense. You suggested: 'Maybe we're overthinking this. Let's just get started and see how it goes.'",
