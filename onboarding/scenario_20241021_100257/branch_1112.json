    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. One of your team members, Sarah, says, 'I don't think we can make it in time. This is too much!' You responded, 'I know it's tough, but let's break it down into smaller tasks and tackle them one by one. We'll get through this together.' Monica and Bob are also present during the discussion. Monica nods in agreement but looks worried. Bob, on the other hand, crosses his arms and seems skeptical. Monica then says, 'I feel like we’re all just going through the motions. It's hard to stay motivated.' You suggested, 'I understand, Monica. Let's have a quick break and share any ideas that might make this project more engaging for everyone.' The team takes a short break, and after returning, Bob still seems unconvinced. Bob then says, 'Even with a break, I don't see how we can pull this off. The deadline is just too tight.' You responded, 'We need to stay focused on what we can control. Let’s outline what’s absolutely essential and prioritize those tasks.' Monica starts jotting down notes, but Bob remains skeptical, leaning back in his chair. Monica looks up and says, 'I think we need more than just prioritizing tasks. This project requires creativity and collaboration, and right now we’re all just stressed out.' You replied, 'I understand the stress is high. Let’s discuss specific areas where we can collaborate more effectively. Any suggestions?' Monica seems thoughtful, while Bob looks downcast.",
