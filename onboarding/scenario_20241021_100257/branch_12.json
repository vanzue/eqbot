    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. One of your team members, Sarah, says, 'I don't think we can make it in time. This is too much!' You responded, 'I know it's tough, but let's break it down into smaller tasks and tackle them one by one. We'll get through this together.' [Monica] and [Bob] are also present during the discussion. Monica nods in agreement but looks worried. Bob, on the other hand, crosses his arms and seems skeptical. Monica then says, 'I feel like we’re all just going through the motions. It's hard to stay motivated.' You replied, 'We've been through tougher situations before. Let's stay focused and keep pushing. We can discuss motivation techniques later.' Bob frowns and leans forward, saying, 'I don’t know if that’s enough. We need a better plan.'",
