    "background": "You are leading a project team that has just received an urgent assignment requiring a significant amount of work to be completed within a tight deadline. The team is feeling a lot of pressure, and morale is low, with some members showing signs of frustration and anxiety. One of your team members, Sarah, says, 'I don't think we can make it in time. This is too much!' You responded, 'I know it's tough, but let's break it down into smaller tasks and tackle them one by one. We'll get through this together.' Monica and Bob are also present during the discussion. Monica nods in agreement but looks worried. Bob, on the other hand, crosses his arms and seems skeptical. Monica then says, 'I feel like we’re all just going through the motions. It's hard to stay motivated.' You suggested, 'I understand, Monica. Let's have a quick break and share any ideas that might make this project more engaging for everyone.' The team takes a short break, and after returning, Bob still seems unconvinced. Bob then says, 'Even with a break, I don't see how we can pull this off. The deadline is just too tight.' You responded, 'I hear you, Bob. What specific concerns do you have? Maybe we can address them together.' Bob sighs and says, 'I just think we’re setting ourselves up for failure.' Monica frowns and looks at Bob, then back at you. Monica then says, 'Maybe we need to reassess our approach. What if we’re not focusing on the right priorities?' You responded, 'I think we need to stick to our current plan and just execute better. Changing priorities now could create more confusion.' Bob still seems skeptical, and Monica looks uncertain about the approach.",
