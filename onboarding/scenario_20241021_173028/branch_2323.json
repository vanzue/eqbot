However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying there's an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task.

You eventually agreed to help immediately, despite the pressure. After facing more complications and expressing your frustration about how the situation should have been handled in your absence, [Monica] and [Bob] continue to seek your help.",
