However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You chose to take a quick look and help out. After some time, [Monica] and [Bob] approach you in the cafeteria. [Monica] looks slightly concerned while [Bob] seems indifferent. You explained that it was a one-time thing to make sure the team didn't struggle. [Monica] frowns slightly, and you expressed that if the team needs you this often, they need to learn to cope without you. [Bob] raises an eyebrow slightly. You agreed with Bob that you should have been more tactful in expressing your concerns.",
