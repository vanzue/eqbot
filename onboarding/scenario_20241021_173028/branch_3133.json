    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying there’s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You chose to prioritize your time off and asked your colleague to reach out to another person. Later, you meet with [Monica] and [Bob] at a team gathering. [Monica] glances at you with a concerned expression, 'Hey [Alex], I heard you didn't help with the urgent task while you were on leave. [Bob] had to stay late to cover for you. What happened?' You responded by saying it was fair to ask someone else to handle it since you were on leave. [Bob] then sighed and said, 'I understand you're on leave, but couldn't you have at least checked in to see if it was really urgent? It put a lot of pressure on us.' You stood your ground and emphasized the importance of respecting each other's time off. [Monica] then added, 'It’s not just about the task, [Alex]. It’s about teamwork and support. How do you think this affects our team dynamic?' You highlighted a potential systemic issue and suggested discussing it with management. The conversation continues with [Monica] and [Bob] still visibly concerned about the team's dynamics and support.",
