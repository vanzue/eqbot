    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You chose to prioritize your time off and asked your colleague to reach out to another person. Later, you meet with [Monica] and [Bob] at a team gathering. [Monica] glances at you with a concerned expression, 'Hey [Alex], I heard you didn't help with the urgent task while you were on leave. [Bob] had to stay late to cover for you. What happened?' You suggest a constructive approach, saying, 'It was a tough call. Maybe we should discuss better ways to handle such situations in the future.' [Bob] nods slightly, but he still looks a bit annoyed.",
