However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying there's an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. Previously, you chose to guide your colleague over the phone, but then [Monica] and [Bob] joined the conversation. [Monica] showed understanding, while [Bob] seemed frustrated. You eventually agreed to help immediately, despite the pressure. After some time trying to resolve the issue, more complications arose, prompting you to provide a cautious response. Now, [Monica] and [Bob] are visibly anxious as the situation remains unresolved.",
