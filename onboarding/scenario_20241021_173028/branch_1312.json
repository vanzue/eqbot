    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You chose to take a quick look and help out. After some time, [Monica] and [Bob] approach you in the cafeteria. [Monica] looks slightly concerned while [Bob] seems indifferent. [Monica] says, 'Hey [Alex], I heard you helped out with the urgent task during your leave. That's really commendable, but don't you think it's setting a precedent for others to bother you on your days off?' You responded assertively, stating that maybe the team needs to be more self-reliant. Now, [Monica] frowns slightly and [Bob] raises an eyebrow. [Bob] remarks, 'Well, if everyone just starts saying no to extra work, won't that leave us in a bind during real emergencies?' You acknowledged the concern while suggesting a constructive solution. [Monica] sighs, and [Bob] shifts his weight uncomfortably. [Monica] says, 'But [Alex], what if the next time it's something you care about deeply? Wouldn't you want the team to pull through for you?' You emphasized the importance of setting boundaries to avoid burnout. Now, [Monica] leans back in her chair, and [Bob] looks at his watch.",
