However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying there's an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. Previously, you chose to guide your colleague over the phone, but then [Monica] and [Bob] joined the conversation. [Monica] showed understanding, while [Bob] seemed frustrated. You chose to prioritize your time off, asking them to find another solution. Now, [Monica] is visibly concerned, and [Bob] appears more agitated. With some body movements, [Monica] leans forward, wringing her hands, while [Bob] crosses his arms tightly. You responded that you would think about it and get back to them.",
