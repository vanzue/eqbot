    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You chose to take a quick look and help out. After some time, [Monica] and [Bob] approach you in the cafeteria. [Monica] looks slightly concerned while [Bob] seems indifferent. You expressed understanding of Monica's concerns and acknowledged you should have set clearer boundaries. [Bob] chimed in, suggesting that it's over the top to worry about boundaries and everyone needs to pitch in when things get tough. You responded by expressing concern for personal boundaries, indicating that pitching in all the time could leave no personal life. [Monica] then expressed worry about the team suffering if no one steps up when needed. In response, you highlighted the risk of burnout and suggested reassessing team priorities.",
