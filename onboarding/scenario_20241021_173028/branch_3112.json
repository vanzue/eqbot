    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You chose to prioritize your time off and asked your colleague to reach out to another person. Later, you meet with [Monica] and [Bob] at a team gathering. [Monica] glances at you with a concerned expression, 'Hey [Alex], I heard you didn't help with the urgent task while you were on leave. [Bob] had to stay late to cover for you. What happened?' You responded by saying it was fair to ask someone else to handle it since you were on leave. [Bob] then sighs and says, 'I understand you're on leave, but couldn't you have at least checked in to see if it was really urgent? It put a lot of pressure on us.' You acknowledged this and said you should have checked in briefly to assess the situation. [Monica] then crossed her arms and added, 'It's not just about this one time, [Alex]. We need to know we can count on each other, even when it's inconvenient.' You responded by emphasizing the need for boundaries. The conversation continues.",
