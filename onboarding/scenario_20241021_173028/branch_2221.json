    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying there's an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. Previously, you chose to guide your colleague over the phone. Now, [Monica] and [Bob] have joined the conversation, adding their perspectives. [Monica] seems understanding, while [Bob] appears frustrated. You acknowledged the urgency but reinforced your boundaries, suggesting to stick with phone guidance. [Bob] sighs, looking increasingly frustrated, 'I donâ€™t think the phone guidance is enough, Alex. We really need your direct involvement.' [Monica] interjects softly, 'Maybe we can find a middle ground? What do you think, Alex?' You suggested a quick video call to resolve it efficiently. Both [Monica] and [Bob] agree and a video call is set up. During the call, [Bob] is still visibly agitated and impatient, while [Monica] remains calm and supportive.",
