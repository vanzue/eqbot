    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying there's an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. Previously, you chose to guide your colleague over the phone. Now, [Monica] and [Bob] have joined the conversation, adding their perspectives. [Monica] seems understanding, while [Bob] appears frustrated. You acknowledged the urgency but reinforced your boundaries, suggesting to stick with phone guidance. Bob sighed, looking increasingly frustrated, and asked for your direct involvement, while Monica suggested finding a middle ground. You then emphasized the importance of disconnecting and asked them to consider other options.",
