However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying there’s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You chose to take a quick look and help out. After some time, [Monica] and [Bob] approach you in the cafeteria. [Monica] looks slightly concerned while [Bob] seems indifferent. You expressed understanding of Monica's concerns and acknowledged you should have set clearer boundaries. Bob commented that worrying about setting boundaries is over the top, and you agreed with him, noting that sometimes sacrifices are necessary for the team. [Monica] looks at you with a mix of disbelief and concern.",
