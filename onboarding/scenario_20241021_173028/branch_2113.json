However, during your time away, a colleague messaged you privately, saying there's an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request created a dilemma as you tried to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. Previously, you chose to guide your colleague over the phone. Now, Monica and Bob have joined the conversation, adding their perspectives. Monica seemed understanding, while Bob appeared frustrated. You offered to do your best to guide them through it quickly. As the call progressed, Monica seemed to be catching on, but Bob was still struggling. When asked to explain in a different way or handle it yourself, you chose to prioritize your rest. Now, the situation has escalated.",
