However, during your time away, a colleague messaged you privately, saying there's an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request created a dilemma as you tried to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. Previously, you chose to guide your colleague over the phone. Now, Monica and Bob have joined the conversation, adding their perspectives. Monica seemed understanding, while Bob appeared frustrated. You offered to do your best to guide them through it quickly, but insisted on sticking to phone guidance. Monica now seems more concerned, while Bob remains impatient. You offered a compromise by starting with phone guidance, but no promises.",
