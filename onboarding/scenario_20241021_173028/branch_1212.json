However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You chose to take a quick look and help out. After some time, [Monica] and [Bob] approach you in the cafeteria. [Monica] looks slightly concerned while [Bob] seems indifferent. You expressed understanding of Monica's concerns and acknowledged you should have set clearer boundaries. [Bob] then chimed in, and you emphasized the need for balance. [Monica] sighed and mentioned her frustration about people not respecting time off. You suggested discussing the matter with the team to set ground rules.",
