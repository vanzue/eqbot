    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You chose to prioritize your time off and asked your colleague to reach out to another person. Later, you meet with [Monica] and [Bob] at a team gathering. [Monica] glances at you with a concerned expression, 'Hey [Alex], I heard you didn't help with the urgent task while you were on leave. [Bob] had to stay late to cover for you. What happened?' You acknowledged the situation and showed willingness to improve, promising to be available next time. [Bob] sighs and folds his arms, 'I get it, but it really put me in a tough spot. How do we ensure this doesn't happen again?' You suggested having a backup plan for such scenarios. [Monica] looks thoughtful and leans forward, 'A backup plan sounds good, but what if it's another emergency and no one else is available?' You proposed rotating on-call duties even during leaves.",
