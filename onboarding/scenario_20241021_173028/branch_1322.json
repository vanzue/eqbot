    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You chose to take a quick look and help out. After some time, [Monica] and [Bob] approach you in the cafeteria. [Monica] looks slightly concerned while [Bob] seems indifferent. [Monica] says, 'Hey [Alex], I heard you helped out with the urgent task during your leave. That's really commendable, but don't you think it's setting a precedent for others to bother you on your days off?' You responded assertively, stating that maybe the team needs to be more self-reliant. [Bob] remarked that saying no to extra work might leave the team in a bind during real emergencies. You agreed with this point. Now, [Monica] looks at you with a concerned expression and asks what should be done in the future. You suggested discussing it in the next team meeting. [Monica] nods slightly, but [Bob] still seems skeptical.",
