However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You chose to take a quick look and help out. After some time, [Monica] and [Bob] approach you in the cafeteria. [Monica] looks slightly concerned while [Bob] seems indifferent. You explained that it was a one-time thing to make sure the team didn't struggle. [Monica] then expressed concern about setting a precedent. You agreed with her point and mentioned that perhaps you should have communicated your limits better. [Bob] smirked and suggested that helping out like that might make you indispensable. You responded by emphasizing the need for balance.",
