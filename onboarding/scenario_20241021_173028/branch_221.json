However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying there's an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. Previously, you chose to guide your colleague over the phone. Now, [Monica] and [Bob] have joined the conversation, adding their perspectives. [Monica] seems understanding, while [Bob] appears frustrated. You acknowledged the urgency but reinforced your boundaries, suggesting to stick with phone guidance. [Bob] sighed, looking increasingly frustrated, and [Monica] interjected softly, suggesting a middle ground. You proposed a quick video call to resolve the issue more efficiently.",
