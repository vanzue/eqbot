During your time away, a colleague messaged you privately, saying there's an urgent task that needs immediate attention. This created a dilemma as you tried to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. Previously, you chose to guide your colleague over the phone. Monica and Bob joined the conversation, adding their perspectives. Monica seemed understanding, while Bob appeared frustrated. You offered to do your best to guide them quickly but later decided to prioritize your time off, suggesting they find another solution. You then proposed a compromise to assist for 30 minutes and then let them take over. Monica and Bob agreed, and you helped for the agreed time. Now, the task is not yet complete, and the conversation continues.",
