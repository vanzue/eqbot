    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You decided to help for a short time but emphasized that you would need to hand it off to someone else after that. You informed your colleagues [Monica] and [Bob] about your decision, and now you're in a video call with them discussing the situation. [Monica] previously asked if you could extend your support, but you reiterated your initial stance. [Bob] now leans back in his chair and says, 'We understand your situation, but this task is critical. Are you sure you can't make an exception for this one time?'",
