However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You decided to help for a short time but emphasized that you would need to hand it off to someone else after that. You informed your colleagues [Monica] and [Bob] about your decision, and now you're in a video call with them discussing the situation. After suggesting to see how much can be done quickly, [Monica] looks a bit hesitant.",
