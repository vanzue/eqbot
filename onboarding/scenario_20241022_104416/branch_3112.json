However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying there’s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You chose to assist despite being on leave, showing good emotional control and motivation. However, this may impact your ability to recharge effectively. You decide to quickly take a look at the task and realize it requires more effort than initially thought. After deciding to handle the task but delegate some parts, you reached out to [Bob] for support and agreed to complete the task with his help. Now, you and [Bob] are discussing the task over a video call, when [Monica] joins the call.",
