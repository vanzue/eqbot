However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You chose to help for a short time but will need to hand it off to someone else. When you informed your colleague about your decision, they appreciated your assistance but mentioned that Bob was struggling to pick up the slack. You agreed to spare a little more time but emphasized that you need to disconnect after that. Later, you receive another message.",
