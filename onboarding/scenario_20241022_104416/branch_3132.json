    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You chose to assist despite being on leave, showing good emotional control and motivation. However, this may impact your ability to recharge effectively. You decide to quickly take a look at the task and realize it requires more effort than initially thought. You commit to finishing the task, showing high motivation and self-regulation, but social skills and emotional perception could be improved. Now, [Monica] and [Bob] are discussing the progress of the task with you. You asked [Bob] if he could handle some of the pending issues.",
