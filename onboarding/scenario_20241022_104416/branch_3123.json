    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You decided to assist despite being on leave, showing good emotional control and motivation. However, this impacted your ability to recharge effectively. You quickly took a look at the task and realized it required more effort than initially thought. When asked to stay on it longer, you prioritized your time off and declined, indicating that someone else would need to take over. [Monica] and [Bob] discuss the situation after your decision. You stood firm on your decision, showing good emotional perception and self-regulation, but social skills could be improved.",
