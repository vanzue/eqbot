    "background": "The team has successfully completed an important project, and everyone is excited to organize a celebration. However, there are differing opinions on how to celebrate. Colleague Sam suggests going to a bar for a lively party, Emma prefers a formal dinner, and Ryan proposes an outdoor team-building activity. You suggested a formal dinner, and everyone agreed to go with it, but now Monica and Bob are discussing the specifics of the dinner. Monica wants a fancy restaurant, while Bob thinks a casual place would be more comfortable. A vote was conducted to decide, and the team chose Monica's suggestion for a fancy restaurant. Now, Monica and Bob are discussing the menu options. Monica prefers a gourmet menu with exotic dishes, while Bob prefers a simple, familiar menu. A vote was conducted to decide, and the team chose Monica's gourmet menu. Now, Monica and Bob are discussing the seating arrangements. Monica prefers assigned seating to encourage mingling, while Bob prefers open seating to allow people to choose where they feel comfortable. Both turn to you for the final say.",
