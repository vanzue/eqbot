    "background": "The team has successfully completed an important project, and everyone is excited to organize a celebration. However, there are differing opinions on how to celebrate. Colleague Sam suggests going to a bar for a lively party, Emma prefers a formal dinner, and Ryan proposes an outdoor team-building activity. You suggested a formal dinner, and everyone agreed to go with it, but now Monica and Bob are discussing the specifics of the dinner. Monica wants a fancy restaurant, while Bob thinks a casual place would be more comfortable. They turn to you for the final say. You chose a fancy restaurant. Now, Monica is thrilled but Bob looks disappointed. Monica and Bob continue discussing other aspects of the dinner, such as the menu and seating arrangements. Monica suggests a gourmet menu with a seating plan, while Bob prefers a more laid-back, buffet-style dinner. You suggested a mix of both options, which Monica and Bob somewhat accepted. Now, the discussion has shifted to the entertainment for the evening. Monica wants a live band to create an elegant atmosphere, while Bob thinks a simple playlist will suffice. Both look at you for the final decision. You decided to have a live band for the first part of the evening and then switch to a playlist for a more relaxed vibe. Now, the topic has shifted to the dress code. Monica wants everyone to dress formally, while Bob thinks a casual dress code is more appropriate.",
