    "background": "The team has successfully completed an important project, and everyone is excited to organize a celebration. However, there are differing opinions on how to celebrate. Colleague Sam suggests going to a bar for a lively party, Emma prefers a formal dinner, and Ryan proposes an outdoor team-building activity. You suggested a formal dinner, and everyone agreed to go with it, but now Monica and Bob are discussing the specifics of the dinner. Monica wants a fancy restaurant, while Bob thinks a casual place would be more comfortable. They turn to you for the final say. You chose a fancy restaurant. Now, Monica is thrilled but Bob looks disappointed. Monica and Bob continue discussing other aspects of the dinner, such as the menu and seating arrangements. Monica suggests a gourmet menu with a seating plan, while Bob prefers a more laid-back, buffet-style dinner. Both look at you for your input. You opted for a vote on Monica's and Bob's options to ensure everyone felt included. The vote was close, but Monica's gourmet menu with a seating plan won. Bob is visibly upset, feeling his preference was overlooked. Monica is planning the seating arrangements, and Bob is starting to feel left out of the celebration planning. You decided to go ahead with the seating plan. Monica is eagerly assigning seats, while Bob is still clearly disengaged. Suddenly, the fire alarm goes off, causing panic in the office. Everyone looks at you for directions.",
