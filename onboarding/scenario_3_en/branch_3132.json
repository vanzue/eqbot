    "background": "The team has successfully completed an important project, and everyone is excited to organize a celebration. However, there are differing opinions on how to celebrate. Colleague Sam suggests going to a bar for a lively party, Emma prefers a formal dinner, and Ryan proposes an outdoor team-building activity. You proposed to vote on each option and go with the majority's choice to ensure everyone feels included. The team agreed, and a vote was conducted. The result was a tie between the formal dinner and the outdoor team-building activity. You suggested combining both, starting with the outdoor activity to unwind and then having a formal dinner to celebrate your achievements. The team seemed to like the idea, but there was still some tension. You then proposed a picnic as a simple and inclusive option. [Monica] and [Bob] are now discussing how to proceed with the picnic plan. You suggested ordering some catering for the food and focusing on having fun. If it rains, you mentioned that you'll figure it out then. The team agrees to your suggestion, but now [Monica] and [Bob] are discussing the details.",
