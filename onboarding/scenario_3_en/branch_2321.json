    "background": "The team has successfully completed an important project, and everyone is excited to organize a celebration. However, there are differing opinions on how to celebrate. Colleague Sam suggests going to a bar for a lively party, Emma prefers a formal dinner, and Ryan proposes an outdoor team-building activity. You suggested a formal dinner, and everyone agreed to go with it, but now Monica and Bob are discussing the specifics of the dinner. Monica wants a fancy restaurant, while Bob thinks a casual place would be more comfortable. A vote was conducted to decide, and the team chose Monica's suggestion for a fancy restaurant. Now, Monica and Bob are discussing the menu options. Monica prefers a gourmet menu with exotic dishes, while Bob prefers a simple, familiar menu. You decided to go with Monica's choice for a gourmet menu. Now, Monica and Bob are discussing the seating arrangements. Monica wants assigned seating for a more formal feel, while Bob prefers open seating for a more relaxed atmosphere. You suggested a mix of both assigned and open seating to accommodate everyone's preferences. Now, Monica and Bob are discussing the entertainment for the evening. Monica suggests hiring a live band for a lively atmosphere, while Bob prefers a quieter setting with background music. They both turn to you for the final say.",
