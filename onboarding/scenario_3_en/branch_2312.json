    "background": "The team has successfully completed an important project, and everyone is excited to organize a celebration. However, there are differing opinions on how to celebrate. Colleague Sam suggests going to a bar for a lively party, Emma prefers a formal dinner, and Ryan proposes an outdoor team-building activity. You suggested a formal dinner, and everyone agreed to go with it, but now Monica and Bob are discussing the specifics of the dinner. Monica wants a fancy restaurant, while Bob thinks a casual place would be more comfortable. A vote was conducted to decide, and the team chose Monica's suggestion for a fancy restaurant. Now, Monica and Bob are discussing the menu options. Monica prefers a gourmet menu with exotic dishes, while Bob prefers a simple, familiar menu. You suggested a mix of gourmet and familiar dishes, and everyone agreed. However, now Monica and Bob are discussing the seating arrangement. Monica wants a formal seating plan, while Bob prefers a more relaxed, free-seating arrangement. You decided to go with Monica's choice for a formal seating arrangement. Now, Monica and Bob are discussing the timing of the speeches during the dinner. Monica wants the speeches to be at the beginning, while Bob thinks they should be after the main course. They turn to you for the final say.",
