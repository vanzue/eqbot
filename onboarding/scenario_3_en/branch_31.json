    "background": "The team has successfully completed an important project, and everyone is excited to organize a celebration. However, there are differing opinions on how to celebrate. Colleague Sam suggests going to a bar for a lively party, Emma prefers a formal dinner, and Ryan proposes an outdoor team-building activity. You proposed to vote on each option and go with the majority's choice to ensure everyone feels included. The team agreed, and a vote was conducted. The result was a tie between the formal dinner and the outdoor team-building activity. [Monica] and [Bob] were looking at you expectantly. You suggested combining both, starting with the outdoor activity to unwind and then having a formal dinner to celebrate your achievements. The team seemed to like the idea, but there was still some tension. [Monica] and [Bob] are now discussing how to proceed with the plan.",
