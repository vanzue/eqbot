    "background": "The team has successfully completed an important project, and everyone is excited to organize a celebration. However, there are differing opinions on how to celebrate. Colleague Sam suggests going to a bar for a lively party, Emma prefers a formal dinner, and Ryan proposes an outdoor team-building activity. You propose to vote on each option and go with the majority's choice to ensure everyone feels included. The team agrees, and a vote is conducted. The result is a tie between the formal dinner and the outdoor team-building activity. [Monica] and [Bob] are looking at you expectantly. You decide to skip the celebration and focus on the next project. Monica frowns and Bob looks disappointed. Monica says, 'I think we deserve a break after all our hard work.' Bob adds, 'Yeah, we need to celebrate, not just jump into more work.' You then choose to go for the outdoor activity but remind them to stay focused afterward. Monica and Bob seem to reluctantly agree. The next day, during a coffee break, [Monica] and [Bob] continue to discuss the celebration plans. Monica says she still thinks a formal dinner would have been a better choice. Bob replies that he gets it, but the outdoor activity will be fun too. You then decide to stick with the outdoor activity as it is a great way to bond and unwind. Monica and Bob nod in agreement. ",
