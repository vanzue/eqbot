    "background": "The team has successfully completed an important project, and everyone is excited to organize a celebration. However, there are differing opinions on how to celebrate. Colleague Sam suggests going to a bar for a lively party, Emma prefers a formal dinner, and Ryan proposes an outdoor team-building activity. You propose to vote on each option and go with the majority's choice to ensure everyone feels included. The team agrees, and a vote is conducted. The result is a tie between the formal dinner and the outdoor team-building activity. Monica says, 'I think the formal dinner would be more appropriate given the hard work we've put in.' Bob counters, 'But we deserve to have some fun and relax, an outdoor activity sounds perfect.' You decide that a formal dinner would be a great way to celebrate. Monica looks pleased, but Bob seems disappointed and crosses his arms. Bob sighs and says, 'Well, if we're doing a formal dinner, I guess we should at least make it interesting. Any ideas?' Monica nods eagerly and adds, 'Yes, let's make it special.' You suggest, 'A few speeches wouldn't hurt. It gives us a chance to reflect on our hard work.' Monica looks pleased, but Bob rolls his eyes.",
