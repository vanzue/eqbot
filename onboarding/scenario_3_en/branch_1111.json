    "background": "The team has successfully completed an important project, and everyone is excited to organize a celebration. However, there are differing opinions on how to celebrate. Colleague Sam suggests going to a bar for a lively party, Emma prefers a formal dinner, and Ryan proposes an outdoor team-building activity. Alex suggests a bit of everything: starting with an outdoor activity, then having dinner, and ending the night at a bar. Monica and Bob have been discussing this, and you notice some tension as they approach you. Alex then suggests a middle ground: a team-building activity followed by dinner, saving the bar for another time. Monica crosses her arms and says, 'Alex, do you really think we can fit all that in one evening? And Bob here thinks we should just stick to one thing.' Bob nods in agreement, looking a bit annoyed. Alex suggests a compromise with a bistro that’s casual but still has great food. Monica raises an eyebrow and says, 'Even with your compromise, we still need to decide on the dinner venue. Bob prefers a fancy restaurant, but I think a casual place would be more relaxed.' Bob sighs, clearly frustrated. Alex suggests focusing on practicality rather than trying to please everyone. Monica leans back in her chair, looking at you expectantly, while Bob frowns and says, 'I just don’t see how we can make everyone happy with this plan.'",
