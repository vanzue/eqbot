    "background": "The team has successfully completed an important project, and everyone is excited to organize a celebration. However, there are differing opinions on how to celebrate. Colleague Sam suggests going to a bar for a lively party, Emma prefers a formal dinner, and Ryan proposes an outdoor team-building activity. You proposed to vote on each option and go with the majority's choice to ensure everyone feels included. The team agreed, and a vote was conducted. The result was a tie between the formal dinner and the outdoor team-building activity. [Monica] and [Bob] were looking at you expectantly. You suggested combining both, starting with the outdoor activity to unwind and then having a formal dinner to celebrate your achievements. The team seemed to like the idea, but there was still some tension. [Monica] and [Bob] discussed how to proceed with the plan. You suggested a simple hike followed by a dinner at a nice restaurant. The team agreed, but now there is a discussion about the specifics. [Monica] says, 'I think we should decide on the restaurant soon. Should we book something fancy or just a nice casual place?' [Bob] adds, 'And what about the hike? Should it be a short and easy trail or something more challenging?' You suggested going for a casual restaurant and a moderate trail that everyone can enjoy. The team accepted the idea, but further details need to be sorted out. [Monica] is now concerned about the logistics and [Bob] is worried about the weather conditions. [Monica] says, 'We should really finalize the plan soon. What if it rains on the day of the hike?' [Bob] adds, 'And what if the restaurant can’t accommodate our group size?' Everyone is looking at you for a solution.",
