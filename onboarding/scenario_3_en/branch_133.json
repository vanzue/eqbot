    "background": "The team has successfully completed an important project, and everyone is excited to organize a celebration. However, there are differing opinions on how to celebrate. Colleague Sam suggests going to a bar for a lively party, Emma prefers a formal dinner, and Ryan proposes an outdoor team-building activity. Alex suggests a bit of everything: starting with an outdoor activity, then having dinner, and ending the night at a bar. Monica and Bob have been discussing this, and you notice some tension as they approach you. Monica crosses her arms and says, 'Alex, do you really think we can fit all that in one evening? And Bob here thinks we should just stick to one thing.' Bob nods in agreement, looking a bit annoyed. After considering their input, Alex suggests going with the majority's preference to avoid any conflicts. Monica and Bob now seem to be waiting for a more concrete plan. Alex then proposes to go with Ryan's suggestion of an outdoor team-building activity. Monica and Bob seem to be contemplating this new suggestion.",
