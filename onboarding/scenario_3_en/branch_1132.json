    "background": "The team has successfully completed an important project, and everyone is excited to organize a celebration. However, there are differing opinions on how to celebrate. Colleague Sam suggests going to a bar for a lively party, Emma prefers a formal dinner, and Ryan proposes an outdoor team-building activity. Alex suggests a bit of everything: starting with an outdoor activity, then having dinner, and ending the night at a bar. Monica and Bob have been discussing this, and you notice some tension as they approach you. Alex then suggests a middle ground: a team-building activity followed by dinner, saving the bar for another time. Monica crosses her arms and says, 'Alex, do you really think we can fit all that in one evening? And Bob here thinks we should just stick to one thing.' Bob nods in agreement, looking a bit annoyed. Alex suggests picking a place that has a bit of both—a bistro that’s casual but still has great food. Monica and Bob still seem unsure. You then suggest going with the majority's preference to avoid any conflicts. Monica rolls her eyes and says, 'So, we’re back to square one? Great.' Bob mutters, 'This is getting exhausting.' Alex then decides to go with a formal dinner. Monica and Bob still seem to be in a tense mood, with Monica tapping her foot impatiently and Bob looking annoyed.",
