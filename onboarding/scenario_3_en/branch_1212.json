    "background": "The team has successfully completed an important project, and everyone is excited to organize a celebration. However, there are differing opinions on how to celebrate. Colleague Sam suggests going to a bar for a lively party, Emma prefers a formal dinner, and Ryan proposes an outdoor team-building activity. Alex suggests a bit of everything: starting with an outdoor activity, then having dinner, and ending the night at a bar. Monica and Bob have been discussing this, and you notice some tension as they approach you. Monica crosses her arms and says, 'Alex, do you really think we can fit all that in one evening? And Bob here thinks we should just stick to one thing.' Bob nods in agreement, looking a bit annoyed. Alex insists that experiencing all three would be a memorable celebration and suggests giving it a try. Monica sighs and says, 'Alright, but what if we end up rushing through everything and no one enjoys any of it?' Bob adds, 'Yeah, and some of us might not even want to go to a bar.' Alex acknowledges their concerns and suggests prioritizing what will make the majority happy. Monica looks puzzled and says, 'How do we even decide what the majority wants? And what if we still can't agree?' Bob shrugs, looking increasingly frustrated. Alex proposes going with the first suggestion that gets enough support.",
