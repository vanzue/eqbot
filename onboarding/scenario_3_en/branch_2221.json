Colleague Sam suggests going to a bar for a lively party, Emma prefers a formal dinner, and Ryan proposes an outdoor team-building activity.

Monica wants a fancy restaurant, while Bob thinks a casual place would be more comfortable. You chose a fancy restaurant. Now, Monica is thrilled but Bob looks disappointed.
