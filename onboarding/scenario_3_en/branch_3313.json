    "background": "The team has successfully completed an important project, and everyone is excited to organize a celebration. However, there are differing opinions on how to celebrate. Colleague Sam suggests going to a bar for a lively party, Emma prefers a formal dinner, and Ryan proposes an outdoor team-building activity. You propose to vote on each option and go with the majority's choice to ensure everyone feels included. The team agrees, and a vote is conducted. The result is a tie between the formal dinner and the outdoor team-building activity. [Monica] and [Bob] are looking at you expectantly. You decide to skip the celebration and focus on the next project. Monica frowns and Bob looks disappointed. You reconsider and suggest a small celebration. Monica lights up and Bob nods in agreement. Monica suggests combining both suggestions with a small outdoor activity followed by a dinner. Bob adds to keep it simple. You express concerns about getting too carried away. Monica sighs, and Bob looks at you with a raised eyebrow.",
