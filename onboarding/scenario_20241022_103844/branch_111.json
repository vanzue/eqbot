However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You responded: 'I understand the urgency, but I am currently on leave. Can you ask someone else to take care of it?' [Monica] replied: 'I understand, but you're the only one who can handle this correctly. It's really important for the project.' You then responded: 'I can help out, but I need some time to get to a place where I can work on it.'",
