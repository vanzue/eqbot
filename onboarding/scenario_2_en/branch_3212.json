    "background": "In a project team, colleague Alex prefers a direct work style, making quick decisions and taking action immediately. Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles lead to a conflict. Previously, you proposed a combined approach that leverages both quick decisions and thorough discussions. During the meeting, [Monica] and [Bob] further escalated the situation with their body language and comments. You then acknowledged their frustration and invited their input. Now, [Bob] raises his voice, saying, 'We need a clear direction, this back and forth is wasting time,' while [Monica] nods in agreement. You addressed the need for clarity and invited Monica to share her perspective. Monica then expressed her concerns, 'I just feel like we're not considering all the details we should.' You suggested setting a time limit for discussing each detail to balance thoroughness and efficiency.",
