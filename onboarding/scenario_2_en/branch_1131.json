    "background": "In a project team, colleague Alex prefers a direct work style, making quick decisions and taking action immediately. Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles lead to a conflict. You intervened and suggested to take a step back and hear each other out, where Alex would go first and then Lily would share her perspective. After Alex presented his points with a sense of urgency, Lily started to share her detailed analysis, but Alex interrupted impatiently. You then asked Lily to quickly finish up so the team could move on. Lily summarized her points, but Alex seemed dissatisfied, rolling his eyes and muttering under his breath. You sought a compromise by asking Lily to provide a concise action plan based on her analysis. Lily quickly outlined her action plan while Alex listened reluctantly, arms still crossed.",
