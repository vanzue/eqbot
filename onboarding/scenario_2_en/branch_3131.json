    "background": "In a project team, colleague Alex prefers a direct work style, making quick decisions and taking action immediately. Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles led to a conflict. Previously, you proposed a combined approach that leverages both quick decisions and thorough discussions. Now, during the meeting, [Monica] and [Bob] further escalate the situation with their body language and comments. [Monica] crosses her arms and sighs, while [Bob] rolls his eyes and mutters, 'This is going nowhere.' You recognized the rising tension and suggested a break to allow everyone to cool down. After the break, the team reconvenes in the meeting room. [Monica] starts to speak up but is interrupted by [Alex] who says, 'We don't have time for this. We need to decide now.' [Lily] looks visibly upset. You tried to steer the conversation back to the main goal. Now, [Bob] and [Monica] exchange skeptical looks, while [Alex] seems impatient. You acknowledged the team's frustration and invited specific suggestions. Now, [Monica] and [Bob] start discussing potential solutions, while [Alex] remains silent and [Lily] looks slightly relieved.",
