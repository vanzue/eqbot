Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles lead to a conflict. Previously, you encouraged mutual understanding and collaboration, emphasizing seeing things from each other's perspective to find common ground. You then aimed to refocus the team by identifying key priorities, but [Monica] and [Bob] still seem frustrated.",
