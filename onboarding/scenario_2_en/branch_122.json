    "background": "In a project team, colleague Alex prefers a direct work style, making quick decisions and taking action immediately. Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles lead to a conflict. You intervened and suggested taking a step back and hearing each other out, where Alex would go first and then Lily would share her perspective. After Alex presented his points with a sense of urgency, Lily started to share her detailed analysis, but Alex interrupted impatiently. You addressed Alex's concerns while emphasizing the importance of listening. Now, there is a tension-filled silence in the room as both Alex and Lily look at you expectantly. You suggested allocating specific times for both approaches. Alex and Lily exchanged looks, and Alex nodded, though reluctantly. Lily appeared thoughtful, yet uncertain.",
