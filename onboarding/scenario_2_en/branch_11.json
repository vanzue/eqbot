    "background": "In a project team, colleague Alex prefers a direct work style, making quick decisions and taking action immediately. Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles lead to a conflict. You intervened and suggested to take a step back and hear each other out, where Alex would go first and then Lily would share her perspective. After Alex presented his points with a sense of urgency, Lily started to share her detailed analysis, but Alex interrupted impatiently. You then asserted control over the situation, ensuring fairness by asking Alex to respect Lily's turn. Lily continued her detailed explanation, but Alex appeared visibly frustrated, tapping his fingers on the table.",
