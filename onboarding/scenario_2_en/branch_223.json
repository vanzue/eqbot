Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles led to a conflict. Previously, you suggested brainstorming together to combine quick decisions with detailed discussions. Now, [Monica] and [Bob] are also present, observing the interaction. Alex and Lily, still showing signs of tension, continue discussing their approaches. Monica and Bob exchange glances, clearly uneasy with the ongoing tension.",
