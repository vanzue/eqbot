Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles led to a conflict. Previously, you suggested leveraging individual strengths by allocating specific tasks to suit each person's approach. Now, [Monica] and [Bob] are also present, observing the interaction. Alex and Lily, despite the new strategy, continue to show signs of tension. Alex is leaning forward, speaking in a raised voice, while Lily is sitting back, looking frustrated.",
