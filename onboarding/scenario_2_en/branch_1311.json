    "background": "In a project team, colleague Alex prefers a direct work style, making quick decisions and taking action immediately. Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles led to a conflict. You intervened and suggested a combined approach that leverages both quick decisions and thorough discussions. Lily then started a detailed analysis, but Alex interrupted impatiently, leading you to ask Lily to quickly outline her main points. After Lily's brief summary, Alex seemed dissatisfied and muttered under his breath. You encouraged open communication and tried to balance both perspectives, asking Alex to share his specific concerns and Lily to ensure addressing Alex's priorities. Now, Lily looks frustrated as Alex continues to push his point forcefully with folded arms, showing visible impatience.",
