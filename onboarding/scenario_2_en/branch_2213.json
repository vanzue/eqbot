    "background": "In a project team, colleague Alex prefers a direct work style, making quick decisions and taking action immediately. Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles lead to a conflict. Previously, you suggested considering both perspectives. Now, Alex and Lily seem calmer but still tense. [Monica] and [Bob] are also present, observing the interaction. Alex and Lily, still showing signs of tension, continue discussing their approaches. Alex insists on quick action, while Lily continues to emphasize thorough discussions. Monica and Bob exchange glances, clearly uneasy with the ongoing tension. After suggesting a brainstorming session to combine quick decisions with detailed discussions, Alex and Lily agree but still seem skeptical.",
