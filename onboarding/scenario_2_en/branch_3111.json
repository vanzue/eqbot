    "background": "In a project team, colleague Alex prefers a direct work style, making quick decisions and taking action immediately. Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles led to a conflict. Previously, you proposed a combined approach that leverages both quick decisions and thorough discussions. Now, during the meeting, [Monica] and [Bob] further escalated the situation with their body language and comments. [Monica] crossed her arms and sighed, while [Bob] rolled his eyes and muttered, 'This is going nowhere.' You recognized the rising tension and suggested a break to allow everyone to cool down. After the break, the team reconvened in the meeting room. [Monica] started to speak up but was interrupted by [Alex] who said, 'We don't have time for this. We need to decide now.' [Lily] looked visibly upset. You facilitated open communication, showing good emotional perception and empathy. [Monica] began to explain her perspective, but [Bob] interjected with a sarcastic remark, 'Oh great, another debate.' You aimed to refocus on the main points, demonstrating solid emotional perception and self-regulation. Now, [Lily] looks to you for guidance while [Monica] frowns and [Alex] checks his watch impatiently.",
