    "background": "In a project team, colleague Alex prefers a direct work style, making quick decisions and taking action immediately. Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles led to a conflict. You intervened and suggested a combined approach that leverages both quick decisions and thorough discussions. Lily started a detailed analysis but was interrupted by Alex, leading you to ask Lily to quickly outline her main points. After Lily's brief summary, Alex muttered under his breath, 'This is still taking too long,' while Lily looked visibly upset. You proposed setting a timer to keep discussions efficient and allotted Lily two more minutes. As the timer ran out, Alex tapped his watch impatiently while Lily looked flustered. You addressed Alex's impatience firmly and urged Lily to conclude quickly. Now, as Lily tries to finish up, Alex looks even more annoyed, and Lily appears on the verge of tears.",
