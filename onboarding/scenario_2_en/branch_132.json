    "background": "In a project team, colleague Alex prefers a direct work style, making quick decisions and taking action immediately. Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles led to a conflict. You intervened and suggested a combined approach that leverages both quick decisions and thorough discussions. Lily then started a detailed analysis, but Alex interrupted impatiently, leading you to ask Lily to quickly outline her main points. After Lily's summary, Alex muttered under his breath, to which you responded by asking Alex to respect the process and Lily to wrap up quickly. Now, after Lily wrapped up, Alex rolls his eyes and mutters again, 'This is why we never get anything done on time.' Lily looks defeated.",
