Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles led to a conflict. Previously, you suggested considering both perspectives and proposed a collaborative solution. Now, Alex and Lily seem calmer but still tense. [Monica] and [Bob] are also present, observing the interaction. Monica and Bob exchange uneasy glances as the tension builds. You involved Monica and Bob in the discussion to find a blended approach.",
