Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles led to a conflict. Previously, you suggested taking a short break to come back with fresh perspectives. Now, [Monica] and [Bob] are also present, observing the interaction. Alex and Lily, still showing signs of tension, continue discussing their approaches. Monica and Bob exchange glances, clearly uneasy with the ongoing tension. Alex is tapping his pen on the table, while Lily is folding her arms, looking defensive.",
