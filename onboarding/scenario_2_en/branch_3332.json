    "background": "In a project team, colleague Alex prefers a direct work style, making quick decisions and taking action immediately. Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles lead to a conflict. Previously, [Monica] and [Bob] further escalated the situation with their body language and comments. You encouraged the team to stay focused and motivated, but tension still lingers. [Monica] glared at [Bob] and said, 'This is why nothing ever gets done.' [Bob] retorted, 'Well, maybe if we didn't overthink everything...' You suggested agreeing to disagree and moving forward, but the tension remains. You then asked everyone to list out what they think is the main issue.",
