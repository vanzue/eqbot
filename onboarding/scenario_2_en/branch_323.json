    "background": "In a project team, colleague Alex prefers a direct work style, making quick decisions and taking action immediately. Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles lead to a conflict. Previously, you proposed a combined approach that leverages both quick decisions and thorough discussions. During the meeting, [Monica] and [Bob] further escalated the situation with their body language and comments. You then acknowledged their frustration and invited their input. [Bob] raised his voice, saying, 'We need a clear direction, this back and forth is wasting time,' while [Monica] nodded in agreement. You emphasized the importance of being thorough to avoid mistakes. Now, [Monica] frowns and says, 'But we can't afford to waste time either.'",
