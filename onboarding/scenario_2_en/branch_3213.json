    "background": "In a project team, colleague Alex prefers a direct work style, making quick decisions and taking action immediately. Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles lead to a conflict. Previously, you proposed a combined approach that leverages both quick decisions and thorough discussions. During the meeting, [Monica] and [Bob] further escalated the situation with their body language and comments. You then acknowledged their frustration and invited their input. [Bob] raised his voice, saying, 'We need a clear direction, this back and forth is wasting time,' while [Monica] nodded in agreement. You addressed the need for clarity and invited Monica to share her perspective. Monica then expressed her concerns, 'I just feel like we're not considering all the details we should.' [Bob] looked annoyed and muttered, 'We don't have time for every single detail.' You proposed a practical way to address both perspectives. Now, [Monica] reluctantly agrees to list the details, but [Bob] still seems dissatisfied, crossing his arms.",
