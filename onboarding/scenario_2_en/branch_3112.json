    "background": "In a project team, colleague Alex prefers a direct work style, making quick decisions and taking action immediately. Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles led to a conflict. Previously, you proposed a combined approach that leverages both quick decisions and thorough discussions. Now, during the meeting, [Monica] and [Bob] further escalated the situation with their body language and comments. [Monica] crossed her arms and sighed, while [Bob] rolled his eyes and muttered, 'This is going nowhere.' You recognized the rising tension and suggested a break to allow everyone to cool down. After the break, the team reconvened in the meeting room. [Monica] started to speak up but was interrupted by [Alex] who said, 'We don't have time for this. We need to decide now.' [Lily] looked visibly upset. You facilitated open communication, showing good emotional perception and empathy. [Monica] begins to explain her perspective, but [Bob] interjects with a sarcastic remark, 'Oh great, another debate.' You encouraged Monica to continue while addressing Bob's sarcasm, showing good empathy and social skills. Monica continues her explanation, but Bob's body language remains dismissive.",
