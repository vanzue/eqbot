    "background": "In a project team, colleague Alex prefers a direct work style, making quick decisions and taking action immediately. Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles led to a conflict. You intervened and suggested a combined approach that leverages both quick decisions and thorough discussions. Lily then started a detailed analysis, but Alex interrupted impatiently, leading you to ask Lily to quickly outline her main points. Now, after Lily's brief summary, Alex seems dissatisfied and mutters under his breath.",
