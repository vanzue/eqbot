    "background": "In a project team, colleague Alex prefers a direct work style, making quick decisions and taking action immediately. Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles lead to a conflict. You intervened and suggested to take a step back and hear each other out, where Alex would go first and then Lily would share her perspective. After Alex presented his points with a sense of urgency, Lily started to share her detailed analysis, but Alex interrupted impatiently. You addressed Alex's concerns while emphasizing the importance of listening. Then, you proposed a hybrid approach to combine both quick decision-making and thorough analysis. You suggested a clear division of tasks based on each person's strengths, and both seemed to agree. Later in the day, while working on their respective tasks, Alex and Lily start to show signs of frustration again.",
