    "background": "In a project team, colleague Alex prefers a direct work style, making quick decisions and taking action immediately. Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles lead to a conflict. Previously, you proposed a combined approach that leverages both quick decisions and thorough discussions. Now, during the meeting, [Monica] and [Bob] further escalate the situation with their body language and comments. You encouraged the team to stay focused and motivated, but tension still lingers. [Monica] glares at [Bob] and says, 'This is why nothing ever gets done.' [Bob] retorts, 'Well, maybe if we didn't overthink everything...'",
