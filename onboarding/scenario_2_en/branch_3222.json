    "background": "In a project team, colleague Alex prefers a direct work style, making quick decisions and taking action immediately. Colleague Lily, however, likes to carefully think things through and only make decisions after thorough discussions. During a project meeting, their differing work styles lead to a conflict. Previously, you proposed a combined approach that leverages both quick decisions and thorough discussions. During the meeting, [Monica] and [Bob] further escalated the situation with their body language and comments. You then acknowledged their frustration and invited their input. [Bob] raised his voice saying, 'We need a clear direction, this back and forth is wasting time,' while [Monica] nodded in agreement. You suggested listing all ideas and voting on the best approach. [Monica] now crosses her arms and adds, 'I just think we're overcomplicating things,' while [Bob] shrugs and says, 'Whatever, let's just get this over with.' You then suggested streamlining the ideas and voting on the key ones. Now, [Monica] looks at you and says, 'I still think we’re missing the bigger picture here,' while [Bob] smirks and says, 'Yeah, let’s not overthink it.'",
