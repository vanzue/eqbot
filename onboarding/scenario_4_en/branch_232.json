    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying there’s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. Your colleague, Mark, messages: 'Hey Alex, I really need your help with this urgent task. Can you help me out?' You responded, 'Mark, I'm currently on leave. Can you ask someone else, or can it wait until I return?' Mark replies, 'I understand you're off, but there's really no one else who can handle this as well as you. It's quite critical.' You then said, 'I understand the urgency. I'll help this time, but please ensure there’s a backup plan for such situations in the future.' Mark, relieved, replies, 'Thanks, Alex. I really appreciate it.' Later, your colleagues Monica and Bob also get wind of the situation. Monica says, 'Alex, it's really nice of you to help out during your leave.' Bob adds, 'But isn't it a bit unfair that you're being pulled in during your time off?' You responded, 'I guess it's part of the job, but it would be nice to have better boundaries.' Bob and Monica exchange glances, clearly agreeing with your sentiment.",
