However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying there’s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You decided to inform Mark that you are on leave and he needs to respect that, highlighting that it is not your job to be available 24/7. A few hours later, you find yourself discussing this situation with Monica and Bob. After explaining that you believe Mark understood your need to set healthy boundaries, the conversation continues. You mentioned that if Mark can't respect your boundaries, then maybe a more serious conversation would be needed.",
