    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You decided to inform Mark that you are on leave and he needs to respect that, highlighting that it is not your job to be available 24/7. Now, a few hours later, you find yourself discussing this situation with Monica and Bob. Monica thought it was a strong stance, and Bob was concerned about the impact on team dynamics. You explained to them that Mark seemed to understand your need for setting healthy boundaries.",
