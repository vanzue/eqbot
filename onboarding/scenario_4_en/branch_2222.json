    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying there’s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. Your colleague, Mark, messages: 'Hey Alex, I really need your help with this urgent task. Can you help me out?' You responded, 'Mark, I'm currently on leave. Can you ask someone else, or can it wait until I return?' Mark replies, 'I understand you're off, but there's really no one else who can handle this as well as you. It's quite critical.' You reiterated, 'Mark, I'm really on leave for a reason. Please find someone else to handle this.' Mark persists, 'I understand you need your time off, but this really can't wait. It’s a critical issue and could affect the whole project if not resolved immediately.' Mark responds, 'Alex, I wouldn't insist if it wasn't important. You're the only one who can handle this.'",
