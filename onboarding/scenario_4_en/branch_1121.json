    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. Your colleague, Mark, messages: 'Hey Alex, I really need your help with this urgent task. Can you help me out?' You decided to help Mark with the urgent task despite being on leave. You've now finished the task and informed Mark about it. Later, [Monica] and [Bob] hear about this and have some thoughts. [Monica] comments, 'I can't believe you agreed to work on your leave, Alex. Don't you think you need to set better boundaries?' while [Bob] adds, 'Yeah, you're always the one stepping in. What if they start expecting it all the time?' You responded, 'I get what you're saying, but I felt it was necessary this time. I'll be more careful in the future.' [Monica] nods thoughtfully and says, 'I understand, but it's important to take care of yourself too.' [Bob] shrugs, 'Well, it's done now. Let's just hope it doesn't become a trend.' You replied, 'I agree, but sometimes you just have to do what feels right in the moment.' [Monica] looks at you, concerned, 'But Alex, if you keep doing this, they might start taking advantage of your kindness.' [Bob] adds, 'Yeah, and what about your own mental health?' You responded, 'Maybe you're right. I should probably be more assertive about my boundaries.'",
