    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You decided to help your colleague Mark this time but asked him to handle such tasks without you while you are on leave. Now, a few hours later, you find yourself discussing this situation with Monica and Bob over a video call. Monica expressed disbelief about Mark's request, and Bob acknowledged that work emergencies happen. You told them you helped but emphasized to Mark the importance of respecting your time off. Monica then asked if Mark at least thanked you, and Bob questioned if Mark promised not to bother you again. You responded saying that you think Mark got the message this time and hoped it sticks.",
