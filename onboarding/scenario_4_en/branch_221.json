However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. Your colleague, Mark, messages: 'Hey Alex, I really need your help with this urgent task. Can you help me out?' You responded, 'Mark, I'm currently on leave. Can you ask someone else, or can it wait until I return?' Mark replies, 'I understand you're off, but there's really no one else who can handle this as well as you. It's quite critical.' You agreed to help and asked Mark to send you the details.",
