    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. Your colleague, Mark, messages: 'Hey Alex, I really need your help with this urgent task. Can you help me out?' You responded, 'Mark, I'm currently on leave. Can you ask someone else, or can it wait until I return?' Mark replied, 'I understand you're off, but there's really no one else who can handle this as well as you. It's quite critical.' You agreed to help and asked Mark to send you the details. After reviewing the task details, you realize it's more extensive than you initially thought. Mark messages again, 'Alex, any update on the task? We really need it done ASAP.' You responded, 'I'll keep working on it, but please make sure to allocate such tasks better in the future.'",

Just then, your other colleagues, Monica and Bob, join the conversation and Bob says, 'Alex, it's really great that you're helping out even while on leave. But don't you think it's setting a precedent for always being available?'",
