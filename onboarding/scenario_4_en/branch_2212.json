    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. Your colleague, Mark, messages: 'Hey Alex, I really need your help with this urgent task. Can you help me out?' You responded, 'Mark, I'm currently on leave. Can you ask someone else, or can it wait until I return?' Mark replies, 'I understand you're off, but there's really no one else who can handle this as well as you. It's quite critical.' You agreed to help and asked Mark to send you the details. After reviewing the task details, you realize it's more extensive than you initially thought. Mark messages again, 'Alex, any update on the task? We really need it done ASAP.' You replied, 'Mark, this is taking longer than expected. Can you get someone to help with parts of it?' Mark responds, 'I understand, but we really need your expertise to ensure it's done correctly. Can you please push through and finish it?'",
