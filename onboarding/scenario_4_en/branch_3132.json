However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You decided to help your colleague Mark this time but asked him to handle such tasks without you while you are on leave.

You mentioned that you decided to help Mark this time but asked him to handle such tasks without you while you're on leave. [Monica] shook her head, [Bob] raised an eyebrow. You stated that if it happens again, you'll remind Mark that you're on leave and he should respect your time off. [Monica] rubbed her temples, while [Bob] nodded slowly.",
