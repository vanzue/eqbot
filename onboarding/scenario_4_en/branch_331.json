However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying there’s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You decided to help your colleague Mark this time but asked him to handle such tasks without you while you are on leave. Now, a few hours later, you find yourself discussing this situation with Monica and Bob over a video call. Monica expressed her disbelief at Mark’s request, and you explained how you handled it. Monica then asked if Mark thanked you, and you replied that Mark was grateful, but you hope he learned to respect your boundaries.",
