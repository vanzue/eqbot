    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying there’s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. Your colleague, Mark, messages: 'Hey Alex, I really need your help with this urgent task. Can you help me out?' You responded, 'Mark, I'm currently on leave. Can you ask someone else, or can it wait until I return?' Mark replies, 'I understand you're off, but there's really no one else who can handle this as well as you. It's quite critical.' You then said, 'I understand the urgency. I'll help this time, but please ensure there’s a backup plan for such situations in the future.' Mark, relieved, replies, 'Thanks, Alex. I really appreciate it.' Later, your colleagues Monica and Bob also get wind of the situation. Monica says, 'Alex, it's really nice of you to help out during your leave.' Bob adds, 'But isn't it a bit unfair that you're being pulled in during your time off?' You replied, 'Well, it's a team effort and I don't mind pitching in occasionally.' Bob looks at you, raising an eyebrow, 'But what if this happens all the time? It sets a precedent, doesn’t it?' You responded, 'If it becomes a problem, I'll address it then. For now, let's just get this done.'",
