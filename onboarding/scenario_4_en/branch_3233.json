    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying there’s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You decided to inform Mark that you are on leave and he needs to respect that, highlighting that it is not your job to be available 24/7. Now, a few hours later, you find yourself discussing this situation with Monica and Bob. [Monica]: 'That’s a strong stance, Alex. Did he react badly?' [Bob]: 'I’d be worried about how that might affect team dynamics in the future. Did you consider that?' You responded that Mark didn’t seem too happy, but you can’t always be on call, stressing that it’s unreasonable. Monica and Bob seem to ponder your response.",
