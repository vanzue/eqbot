    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying there’s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You decided to help your colleague Mark this time but asked him to handle such tasks without you while you are on leave. Now, a few hours later, you find yourself discussing this situation with Monica and Bob. [Monica] crossed her arms and sighed, while [Bob] leaned against the wall, looking thoughtful. [Monica] said, 'I can't believe Mark asked you to work during your leave. That's so inconsiderate.' [Bob] replied, 'Yeah, but sometimes work emergencies happen. How did you handle it, Alex?' You responded by saying you told Mark you’d help this time but asked him to handle such tasks without you in the future.",
