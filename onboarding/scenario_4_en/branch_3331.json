    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying there’s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. You decided to help your colleague Mark this time but asked him to handle such tasks without you while you are on leave. Now, a few hours later, you find yourself discussing this situation with Monica and Bob over a video call. [Monica]: 'I can't believe Mark asked you to work during your leave. That's so inconsiderate.' [Bob]: 'Yeah, but sometimes work emergencies happen. How did you handle it, Alex?' You: 'I told Mark I’d help this time but asked him to handle such tasks without me in the future.' [Monica]: 'Did Mark at least thank you?' [Bob]: 'And did he promise not to bother you again?' You: 'He did appreciate my help, but it seemed like he didn't fully get the message.' [Monica]: 'So, what will you do if this happens again?' [Bob]: 'Yeah, what’s your plan for next time?' You: 'I guess I'll have to remind him more firmly about my boundaries.'",
