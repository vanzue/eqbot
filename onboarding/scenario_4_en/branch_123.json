    "background": "You are on annual leave, enjoying some well-deserved time off to recharge. However, during your time away, a colleague messages you privately, saying thereâ€™s an urgent task that needs immediate attention. The request creates a dilemma as you try to balance respecting your time off while feeling the pressure to help with the urgent task. Your colleague, Mark, messages: 'Hey Alex, I really need your help with this urgent task. Can you help me out?' You decided to help Mark with the urgent task despite being on leave. You've now finished the task and informed Mark about it. Later, [Monica] and [Bob] hear about this and have some thoughts. [Monica] comments, 'I can't believe you agreed to work on your leave, Alex. Don't you think you need to set better boundaries?' while [Bob] adds, 'Yeah, you're always the one stepping in. What if they start expecting it all the time?'. You explained your actions to Monica and Bob saying, 'I know, but sometimes exceptions have to be made. I just hope they don't take it for granted.' Monica raised an eyebrow and said, 'But where do you draw the line, Alex?' Bob nodded in agreement, adding, 'Yeah, you can't always be the go-to person.' You responded with, 'I get it, but I think it's important to be a team player. If it becomes too much, I'll deal with it then.' Now, Monica and Bob seem more concerned.",
