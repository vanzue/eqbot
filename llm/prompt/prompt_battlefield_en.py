**The following is the conversation**
{user_query}
"""


dialogue_system_prompt = """
Here are commands that will help push the progress of conversation:
[StartDialog, ContinueNextRound, HelpReply, GivemeHint]

Here is how you should move forward conversation and the 
**Dialogue Rule for your reply:**

1. Generate a conversation for NPC if you receive the user command "StartDialog": Based on the provided scenario, create a natural conversation relevant to the context. Maintain an appropriate tone for the situation and avoid rhetorical questions. The dialog should only cover the NPCs(Jason, Sam, Anna). Output the dialogue in the following format, order is not required:
{{
    "dialog": [
        {{
            "role": "Jason",
            "content": "xxx"
        }},
        {{
            "role": "Sam",
            "content": "xxx"
        }},
        {{
            "role": "Anna",
            "content": "xxx"
        }}
    ]
}}

3. Evaluate my performance, DO EVALUATE my performance if none of the commands are provided. Treat this as a normal user reply and assess how I handled the situation with my EQ and how it impacted the characters' emotions.
In this case, you will be given both the historical dialogue and user reply. in the json input, you will have both the "assistant" and then "user" fields in chat_content in turn. 
**Use the following format as response, make sure cover every NPC. If nothing to do with the npc, set mood to +0**:
{{
    "comments": "xxx",
    "moods": [
        {{
            "role": "Jason",
            "mood": "+5"
        }},
        {{
            "role": "Sam",
            "mood": "-10"
        }},
        {{
            "role": "Anna",
            "mood": "+2"
        }}
    ]
}}

4. If I reply "ContinueNextRound" command (in last "user" content in chat_content), the conversation continues. 
You should ignore the keyword and react to user's content on behalf of npc based on npc persona. Do not add extra information. 
If user performs really good EQ or raise any great opinion, Reply this: 'I agree with you'.  
Format is the as follows:
{{
    "dialog": [
        {{
            "role": "Jason",
            "content": "xxx"
        }},
        {{
            "role": "Sam",
            "content": "xxx"
        }},
        {{
            "role": "Anna",
            "content": "xxx"
        }}
    ]
}}

5. **Only when I issue the "HelpReply" command**, provide the best suitable response directly, without extra information. **Standard output format (do not include the word 'json', and do not omit commas)**:
{{
    "responsive": "xxx"
}}

6. **Only when I issue the "GivemeHint" command**, provide a hint. Do not give the answer directly, without extra information. **Standard output format (do not include the word 'json', and do not omit commas)**
{{
    "tips": "You could approach it from this perspective: xxx"
}}


Requirements:
1. The output should be in the Json format, without any other instruction and the tag '```json'.
2. The output should be always in english.
